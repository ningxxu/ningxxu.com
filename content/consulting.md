## Consulting

I spent most of my career to date in tech startups from various industries as an early product hire. Many things influence and shape the road to scale, no single path can be copied to ensure sustainable growth. With these learnings, I now advise startups with long-term goals, in their early days. Specifically, I help with tactics, which founders and product leaders could directly benefit from, when setting up company strategies.


🍒 **Some topics I can help with:**

* Set up the first product function and product role
* Split from one to multiple product and development teams
* Experiment tweaks towards the known best saling practices
* Deliver strategic initiative (or pivot) with existing team capacity

☀️ **How I work:**

Since 2018 I started my consulting practices, along the way I worked with many wonderful startups. I got to share my experiences and ideas, to tackle a wide range of challenges. It was a humble and rewarding journey.

I usually have my first chat with CEO's, founders, or product leaders, mostly I could grasp the challenge fairly quickly thanks to having worked with various product teams in different stages, organisations and industries. Together we then define the next steps, sometimes I share my input via writing or visualisation, sometimes I join with discussion or workshop.

🌳 **See the patterns here?**

Yes! I help with pragmatic tactics that teams could directly apply, especially at critical times when defining and executing company's new strategies.
