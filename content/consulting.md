## Consulting

I spent most of my career to date in tech startups from various industries as an early product hire. Many things influence and shape the road to scale, no single path can be copied to ensure sustainable growth. With these learnings, I now advise startups with long-term goals, on the early-stage strategy.

üçí **Some topics I can help with:**

* Set up the first product function and product role
* Split from one to multiple product and development teams
* Experiment innovative tweaks towards the known best practices
* Deliver strategic initiative (or pivot) with existing team capacity

üå≥ **How I work:**

Since 2018 I started my consulting practices, along the way I worked with many wonderful startups. I got to share my experiences and ideas, to tackle a wide range of challenges. It was a humble and rewarding journey.

I usually have my first chat with CEO's, founders, or product leaders, mostly I grasp the challenge fairly quickly thanks to having worked with various product teams in different stages, organisations and industries. Together we then define the next steps, sometimes I share my input via writing or visualisation, sometimes I join with discussion or workshop.

I also give talks in meetups and unconferences (I prefer indie and grassroots events), and I've helped individuals with tips to product challenges. I do not metor individuals at this moment, I find in most cases we can't keep seperate a work self and a non-work self, mentoring an individual is in my opinion a much heavier take. Whenever I work with the founders and leaders, I always emphasize the importance of every individuals in team, which're critical pieces in the whole puzzle.

If you're building products and teams, I'd love to hear from you.
