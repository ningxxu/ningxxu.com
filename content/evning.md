### I'm working on something new!

🌒 In 2018 when I first started consulting on a freelance basis, I named my company "Evning". I was working outuside of my day job, hence, Evening. Plus Evning is a combination of my name and my lifelong partner's.


👶 In 2020 we had our first child, who is growing up in a multicultural, or as sometimes me and my partner call "weird", environment. My attention was drawn to all things in early development for children in multicultural and multilingual environment.

🙋‍♀️ I'm working on something new related to these topics, with "Evning" as a working title. I want to make certain things easier and more accessible for the parents, children and families like mine.
