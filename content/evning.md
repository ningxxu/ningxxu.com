### I'm working on something new!

ðŸŒ’ In 2018 when I first started consulting on a freelance basis, I named my company "Evning". I was working outuside of my day job, hence, Evening. Plus the name is a combination of my own name and my lifelong partner's.


ðŸ‘¶ In 2020 we had our first child, who is growing up in a super multicultural, or as sometimes me and my partner call "weird", environment. My attention was drawn with all things in early child development x multicultural and multilingural.

**I'm working on something new related to these topics.**

If you are from or are raising a family in a multicultural or multilingural environment, I'd like to hear from you.

Drop me a line via [hello@ningxxu.com](mailto:hello@ningxxu.com) and I will get back to you.
