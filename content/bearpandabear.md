#### A collection of solutioins that will help parents, children and families in multicultural and multilingual environment

👶 My partner and I came from completely different background, we met in yet a third completely different environment in a different part of the world and started a familiy together. Some years back we had our first child, who is growing up in a multicultural, or as sometimes we call "weird", environment. My attention was drawn to all things in early development for children in multicultural and multilingual environment.

🙋‍♀️ I'm working on solving pain points related to these topics. I want to make certain things easier and more accessible for the parents, children and families like mine.
