Keywords: the forth leap, change of schedule

* I’m a strong believer of the so-called “leap”, the difficult moments that baby needs to go through due to their mental development. Around 4-5 month the baby will go through the forth leap which is a major one and a huge challenge for parents.
* Some sources will also mention the term “Sleep Regression”, which based on my experience happened around similar time with the “leap”, so I would assume it is development related. It’s when the baby seem to forget everything they have learned about sleep and start to wake up more frequently again. The “Sleep Regression” will go away, and once it’s over it’s the time that the sleeping patterns change and that the baby will adjust to their new schedule.
* Baby will be able to stay without feed for longer time, which will also create (good) changes in the daily schedule.
* Some baby may still not able to sleep long nap, and because of longer hours without feeding (4-5h), for some babies they may have 2 naps between feeds, that’s ok.
* It’s a good moment to start training the baby to sleep on their own, there’re lots of methods on the internet, but do it your own way. The goal is to help babies learn how to sleep, keep in mind sleeping is a skill that baby needs to learn.
