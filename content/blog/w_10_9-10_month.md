Keywords: standing (and walking)

* The schedule remained same, with 2 day naps.
* Internet talks about baby led weaning, we didn’t have a plan or what so ever, we just go with every meal, sometimes we feed with a spoon from bottled baby food (vegetables, meat, fruits, carbs), sometimes we give chunks of vegetables and fruits for the baby to grab on their own, sometimes we mix grains and breast milk and feed with spoon, and the baby still drinks breast milk.
* The baby can now easily stand up without any help, walk along support such as the couch for quite some distance, and walk 4-5 steps without any support till sit down on their own. I was told doing this at age of 10 month is quite early so “walking” might not be a keyword you should look at this age.
