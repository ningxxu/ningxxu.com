Keywords: curiously discovering

* The baby at this point will really be another adult in the household, they have a set of schedule that match adults‚Äô life: several meals a day, a night sleep and some naps during the day.
* They will show more and more emotions, the cry nowadays is never the screaming cry when they were newborns, they laugh and show you the true happiness.
* Some may mention the 8 months regression which is yet another developmental milestone where the baby learns more about the real world events, relationships, and categorisations.
* Some babies will be able to stand or walk, or crawl around everywhere.
* They babble back to you, or babble themselves with more and more different sounds, they‚Äôre ready to talk soon.
