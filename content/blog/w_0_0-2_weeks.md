* 0-2 weeks babies are considered newborns. Newborns don’t have the ability to adjust their temperature, so you need to make sure that they are warm, check the temperature every time when you change diaper to be sure.
* Babies sleep a lot during these weeks, but you do need to feed them very often, typically every 2 hours.
* If you opt in for breastfeeding, the first week is very critical, make sure to keep letting the baby drink from your breasts. The first week is challenging in a lot of ways: milk production, pain and uncomfortableness, and baby drinking position, etc. Trust me in most cases it will work out eventually, if you could get help from professionals, do it.
* It’s quite common for new mom to not have enough milk in the very first days, which could result in the baby not getting enough food. If this is the case, it’s fine to give the baby formula, and at the same time to use a pump to stimulate the milk production, preferably professional ones that you could rent from a hospital. It’s true that there’s a chance that the baby will be confused by nipple and teat, therefore if there’s just enough milk production you do not want to give baby bottle in the first week. But the priority should be to make sure that they’re not hungry. The baby will let you know if they’re not having enough milk, by crying. You may also want to note down the number of full diapers to know that they’re drinking enough.
* Besides the constant feeding, the first 2 weeks is actually relatively easy, simply because babies sleep a lot and haven’t start their crying yet.
