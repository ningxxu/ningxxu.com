Keywords: dropping naps but not this'll take a while, intelligent

* With some babies, you will really see that naps are being dropped, but it won't happen overnight and then they start new schedule, instead, it's a back and forth process that will take a while, perhaps for months.
* Some days you see a super energetic baby in the morning, play, smile, and doesn't seem to need to nap, they then stay awake after lunch and you will want to put them for a nap. Some days they still get cranky right after breakfast and need to nap in the morning.
* You can forget about any fixed schedule and just keep an eye on how the baby is doing, go with your instinct. After a while, they will transit into 1 nap during the day.
* You'll also notice that your baby is now more intelligent, they started to find their systems, they can understand you a lot, they can follow your instructions, and the way they play toys become more meaningful in a sense that how an adult would usually play.
