Keywords: sleep, cry, cry, cry

* You will notice that your baby started to cry more, much more than first 2 weeks. Cry is normal, it will go away, eventually. I won‚Äôt say when because you may have false hope, but it will get better.
* Some baby may have difficulties in sleeping. Although the best is to let them sleep on their own bed, it is fine to find ways that would let the baby sleep or help them sleep when they are this young. They may sleep on you, or your bed (with your supervision!), better than on their own bed.
* It is already a good idea to try out a schedule, if you google baby schedule or routine, you will find a lot. Try them all out. To keep a schedule is important, but it‚Äôs also very hard. Your baby is not a machine, every day varies.
* Your baby is growing a lot, growth makes them uncomfortable, they will cry, that‚Äôs their only way to express.
* Every time after the baby drinks, hold them up straight to help them burp, this is very important, do this.
* Use a baby nose cleaner.
