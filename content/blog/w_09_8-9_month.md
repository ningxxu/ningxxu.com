Keywords: isnâ€™t parenting easy, nah, itâ€™s just beautifully structured

* Perhaps these months are the easiest months ever since the birth of the baby: they have now regular schedules and most of them enjoy long night sleep (if you have managed to train them well till this point), but also the baby are yet ready to have their own self identity and yet to start asking lots of why (which makes parents tiring).
* Looking back, you remember that first months were difficult, but you donâ€™t remember anymore what exactly that you went through, you only know that it was difficult, but yet you and your baby are here.
* I tend to think that this whole parenting thing is structured naturally so beautiful. Parenting is of course a hard, hard thing, it would never be easy, and thatâ€™s why it all starts with the hardest level â€“ the fragile and screaming-for-hours newborn. Yet just couple months before we enter toddlerhood, you enjoy these relatively easy time period to prepare yourself for the next phase.
* Enjoy the raspberry blowing, enjoy the drooling, enjoy the endless curiosity before thereâ€™re even words spoken, enjoy everything ðŸ™‚
