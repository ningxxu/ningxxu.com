Keywords: More active, schedule slightly easier

* The baby will be more active now, they will start showing interest in things. You can show your baby things around the house and outside. They will start learning about their own bodies and use them more.
* Some babies may need to be fed less frequently at this age, but some may still have similar frequency as before. This applies to both during the day as well as night feeds.
* Not to give you too high of a hope but if you’ve made it this far, I want to let you know that with the baby growing up, the schedule will become easier. You will still have difficult days or weeks (remember that babies are growing and growing makes them uncomfortable), but overall, it’ll become easier. Try learn more about your baby’s preferences and patterns, try different methods to deal with things like extending the short sleep, cutting the night feed, or training to self soothe, etc. And you’ll get there.
