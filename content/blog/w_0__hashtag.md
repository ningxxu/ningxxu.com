Parenting is a journey with lots of aha moments. Those aha moments make you feel great, but every time when you think that you have it all figured out, you’re pretty much guaranteed to be confused again immediately. It never gets easier, it never ends. I decided to document those aha moments on a regular basis with writing and data visualization (hashtag p_text and p_dataviz). If you’re desperately searching on the internet and happen to land on one of those blogs, I hope it also brings you some aha moments, because you’re doing just fine.
