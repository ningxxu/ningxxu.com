Keywords: some delightful changes after some unchanged period

* At this stage, it still can happen that babies take 2 naps, but often days 1 nap is enough.
* Typically when baby started going to daycare, the parents' nightmare of "building up immune system" starts, in extreme case, you can expect every week with a sick kid, and every other week high fever and more serious symptoms.
* The keyword intelligent still plays a role here! Many many more first time again! Gave food to parents, rolled around on the floor enjoying it, walked with balance bike, started using spoons, kissed parents, walked on stairs with help, wiped face with a napkin, and many many more moments!
