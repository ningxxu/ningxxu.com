Keywords: start talking sentences

* The kid now started repeating and talking sentences, the first time to experience this, is very sweet.
* They are able to tell you to do something, in very short sentences, which they learned from you, and sometimes, even with some tweaks added by themselves.
* They ask you to sit nearby, read them a book, draw with them, and they want to have you near them all the time even if they decided to play a bit themselves.
* The one midday nap schedule remained unchanged and for high chance will remain this way for several years, good for those who like to have some routine.
* You may want to train them to play by themselves here and there, not an easy task :-)
