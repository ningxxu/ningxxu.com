Keywords: lots of new learnings and developments

* The kid now can repeat after you a lot of words, they hesitate with certain ones and choose not to repeat, which is interesting to see.
* For multi-language families, you might also notice the kid has preferences in repeating words from certain language.
* It seems all happened over night, that they gained more interest in speaking, and it happens more and more and more, absolute fun to hear and see!
* Depending on the family environment as well as personality, the kid might still be developing their socialising skills and still play mostly by themselves with toys and not interacting with other kids that much just yet.
