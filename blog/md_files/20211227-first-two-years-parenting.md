First time becoming parents is always overwhelming no matter what, especially in the first couple of months and if by any chance you welcomed a new life who could be, somewhat, demanding.
Often I felt that I've figured out, but the next day the situations immediately changed and I need to figure out all over again. It's like what you learned might not be valid the next moment.
Here I wrote down here things that seem to have stayed true with my experience.



0-2 weeks

Keywords: keep baby warm, breastfeeding stimulation (if you opt in for breastfeeding), rest

* 0-2 weeks babies are considered newborns. Newborns don’t have the ability to adjust their temperature, so you need to make sure that they are warm, check the temperature every time when you change diaper to be sure.
* Babies sleep a lot during these weeks, but you do need to feed them very often, typically every 2 hours.
* If you opt in for breastfeeding, the first week is very critical, make sure to keep letting the baby drink from your breasts. The first week is challenging in a lot of ways: milk production, pain and uncomfortableness, and baby drinking position, etc. Trust me in most cases it will work out eventually, if you could get help from professionals, do it.
* It’s quite common for new mom to not have enough milk in the very first days, which could result in the baby not getting enough food. If this is the case, it’s fine to give the baby formula, and at the same time to use a pump to stimulate the milk production, preferably professional ones that you could rent from a hospital. It’s true that there’s a chance that the baby will be confused by nipple and teat, therefore if there’s just enough milk production you do not want to give baby bottle in the first week. But the priority should be to make sure that they’re not hungry. The baby will let you know if they’re not having enough milk, by crying. You may also want to note down the number of full diapers to know that they’re drinking enough.
* Besides the constant feeding, the first 2 weeks is actually relatively easy, simply because babies sleep a lot and haven’t start their crying yet.


0-1 month

Keywords: sleep, cry, cry, cry

* You will notice that your baby started to cry more, much more than first 2 weeks. Cry is normal, it will go away, eventually. I won’t say when because you may have false hope, but it will get better.
* Some baby may have difficulties in sleeping. Although the best is to let them sleep on their own bed, it is fine to find ways that would let the baby sleep or help them sleep when they are this young. They may sleep on you, or your bed (with your supervision!), better than on their own bed.
* It is already a good idea to try out a schedule, if you google baby schedule or routine, you will find a lot. Try them all out. To keep a schedule is important, but it’s also very hard. Your baby is not a machine, every day varies.
* Your baby is growing a lot, growth makes them uncomfortable, they will cry, that’s their only way to express.
* Every time after the baby drinks, hold them up straight to help them burp, this is very important, do this.
* Use a baby nose cleaner.


1-2 month

Keywords: try to learn your baby

* You may start learning what your baby wants, you could pay attention to baby’s facial expression, sound or types of cry to learn the cues such as hunger, sleepy, gas or poop.
* Try to keep a schedule, around this time baby may eat every 2-3 hours.
* Often suggested schedule is: nap, feed, diaper, play, nap. However it may not work, especially for babies who can’t sleep long naps.
* Quite some babies are short sleepers at this age, they will wake up after a very short nap. Being able to transit into next sleep is a skill that most babies in this age couldn’t master. If the nap is shorter than 40-45min, always try to calm the baby down to see if you could help them continue napping. If the nap is longer than 40-45min, then try to see what they want and decide if you would try to get them to nap again or not.
* Don’t beat yourself hard if you can’t really follow the schedule, again schedule is important but it is difficult. Try to stay relaxed with your baby.
* Do tummy time, several times a day.
* The baby will still cry a lot, a lot, especially in the evenings and at night.
* It takes quite some effort to calm the baby down and to get them to sleep, but you should do it. To help them get enough sleep is important in this stage.


2-3 month

Keywords for this period: holding head up, first smile

* Your baby will be much more active by now, they usually can hold their head up while on their tummy, but no need to worry if they’re slower. Help them by exercising a couple of times a day.
* The schedule may need some changes but roughly it could stay similar as previous month.
* The baby will still cry a lot and it’s still a lot of work to help him sleep.


3-4 month

Keywords: More active, schedule slightly easier

* The baby will be more active now, they will start showing interest in things. You can show your baby things around the house and outside. They will start learning about their own bodies and use them more.
* Some babies may need to be fed less frequently at this age, but some may still have similar frequency as before. This applies to both during the day as well as night feeds.
* Not to give you too high of a hope but if you’ve made it this far, I want to let you know that with the baby growing up, the schedule will become easier. You will still have difficult days or weeks (remember that babies are growing and growing makes them uncomfortable), but overall, it’ll become easier. Try learn more about your baby’s preferences and patterns, try different methods to deal with things like extending the short sleep, cutting the night feed, or training to self soothe, etc. And you’ll get there.


4-5 month

Keywords: the forth leap, change of schedule

* I’m a strong believer of the so-called “leap”, the difficult moments that baby needs to go through due to their mental development. Around 4-5 month the baby will go through the forth leap which is a major one and a huge challenge for parents.
* Some sources will also mention the term “Sleep Regression”, which based on my experience happened around similar time with the “leap”, so I would assume it is development related. It’s when the baby seem to forget everything they have learned about sleep and start to wake up more frequently again. The “Sleep Regression” will go away, and once it’s over it’s the time that the sleeping patterns change and that the baby will adjust to their new schedule.
* Baby will be able to stay without feed for longer time, which will also create (good) changes in the daily schedule.
* Some baby may still not able to sleep long nap, and because of longer hours without feeding (4-5h), for some babies they may have 2 naps between feeds, that’s ok.
* It’s a good moment to start training the baby to sleep on their own, there’re lots of methods on the internet, but do it your own way. The goal is to help babies learn how to sleep, keep in mind sleeping is a skill that baby needs to learn.


5-6 month

Keywords: much active, lots of first time

* It’s a period that lots of progress will be made, and therefore a much rewarding period for the new parents. Most babies will begin to flip themselves, or roll, they will do more babbling, they might whine more while awake, as they transit to the ability of speaking later.
* It’s a period that lots of magic happen, they will start solids (probably you already started giving earlier), it’ll become easier to put them to sleep (if you’ve previously trained them somehow, or you may want to start training now).
* Everything seems to become easier for the parents and it’s true, however, you need to set the right expectation, which is, overall things are getting easier and easier but there’ll be back and forth, and there’ll be difficult days.


6-7 month

Keywords: Schedule more regular, Sleep longer during the day

* By then most of the time you’ll feel that situation is more under control, as there’re more predictable schedule from your baby, however, there still can be surprises
* Most babies will be able to transit into second or even third sleep cycle (usually 30-40min) in one day nap, which creates some moments for the tiring parents to relax or get other things done
* Most babies will also be staying awake longer, they can sit well, stand with your help, they’ll be babbling a lot more, smiling a lot more, and they crawl much further, grab a low chair while on their knee, which enables them to see a lot more, the sweetest moments that you can have with them.


7-8 month

Keywords: curiously discovering

* The baby at this point will really be another adult in the household, they have a set of schedule that match adults’ life: several meals a day, a night sleep and some naps during the day.
* They will show more and more emotions, the cry nowadays is never the screaming cry when they were newborns, they laugh and show you the true happiness.
* Some may mention the 8 months regression which is yet another developmental milestone where the baby learns more about the real world events, relationships, and categorisations.
* Some babies will be able to stand or walk, or crawl around everywhere.
* They babble back to you, or babble themselves with more and more different sounds, they’re ready to talk soon.


8-9 month

Keywords: isn’t parenting easy, nah, it’s just beautifully structured

* Perhaps these months are the easiest months ever since the birth of the baby: they have now regular schedules and most of them enjoy long night sleep (if you have managed to train them well till this point), but also the baby are yet ready to have their own self identity and yet to start asking lots of why (which makes parents tiring).
* Looking back, you remember that first months were difficult, but you don’t remember anymore what exactly that you went through, you only know that it was difficult, but yet you and your baby are here.
* I tend to think that this whole parenting thing is structured naturally so beautiful. Parenting is of course a hard, hard thing, it would never be easy, and that’s why it all starts with the hardest level – the fragile and screaming-for-hours newborn. Yet just couple months before we enter toddlerhood, you enjoy these relatively easy time period to prepare yourself for the next phase.
* Enjoy the raspberry blowing, enjoy the drooling, enjoy the endless curiosity before there’re even words spoken, enjoy everything 🙂


9-10 month

Keywords: standing (and walking)

* The schedule remained same, with 2 day naps.
* Internet talks about baby led weaning, we didn’t have a plan or what so ever, we just go with every meal, sometimes we feed with a spoon from bottled baby food (vegetables, meat, fruits, carbs), sometimes we give chunks of vegetables and fruits for the baby to grab on their own, sometimes we mix grains and breast milk and feed with spoon, and the baby still drinks breast milk.
* The baby can now easily stand up without any help, walk along support such as the couch for quite some distance, and walk 4-5 steps without any support till sit down on their own. I was told doing this at age of 10 month is quite early so “walking” might not be a keyword you should look at this age.


10-11 month

Keywords: walking, waving, clapping

* The baby can now walk quite stable, often walk on their own to different rooms in the house, yet know that climbing is their faster option.
* During the day, there’re still 2 naps, each lasts about 1.5 hour, the schedule hasn’t changed for couple of months already.
* They also know to wave to you, high five, and often clap hands.
* They dance, or make small jumps, along the music.
* I decided not to wean just yet but reduced the amount of breastmilk feeding.



11-12 month

Keywords: dropping naps, getting sick

* As the baby gets older, the un-changed schedule is about to change, for some babies it’s possible around this age to start dropping 2 naps to 1 nap, for some others the change will only starts in some more months. The transition period can take months as well, which makes it challenging as you may experience different schedules in different days.
* Most babies start to get sick more often, experiencing their very first serious cold or fever, as important as it is for babies to build up their immune system, those will be extremely challenging times for parents. Cry is pretty much the only way babies could express themselves as they’re not feeling comfortable.



12-14 month

Keywords: dropping naps but not this'll take a while, intelligent

* With some babies, you will really see that naps are being dropped, but it won't happen overnight and then they start new schedule, instead, it's a back and forth process that will take a while, perhaps for months.
* Some days you see a super energetic baby in the morning, play, smile, and doesn't seem to need to nap, they then stay awake after lunch and you will want to put them for a nap. Some days they still get cranky right after breakfast and need to nap in the morning.
* You can forget about any fixed schedule and just keep an eye on how the baby is doing, go with your instinct. After a while, they will transit into 1 nap during the day.
* You'll also notice that your baby is now more intelligent, they started to find their systems, they can understand you a lot, they can follow your instructions, and the way they play toys become more meaningful in a sense that how an adult would usually play.


14-16 month

Keywords: some delightful changes after some unchanged period

* At this stage, it still can happen that babies take 2 naps, but often days 1 nap is enough.
* Typically when baby started going to daycare, the parents' nightmare of "building up immune system" starts, in extreme case, you can expect every week with a sick kid, and every other week high fever and more serious symptoms.
* The keyword intelligent still plays a role here! Many many more first time again! Gave food to parents, rolled around on the floor enjoying it, walked with balance bike, started using spoons, kissed parents, walked on stairs with help, wiped face with a napkin, and many many more moments!


16-18 month

Keywords: lots of new learnings and developments

* The kid now can repeat after you a lot of words, they hesitate with certain ones and choose not to repeat, which is interesting to see.
* For multi-language families, you might also notice the kid has preferences in repeating words from certain language.
* It seems all happened over night, that they gained more interest in speaking, and it happens more and more and more, absolute fun to hear and see!
* Depending on the family environment as well as personality, the kid might still be developing their socialising skills and still play mostly by themselves with toys and not interacting with other kids that much just yet.


18-21 month

Keywords: start talking sentences

* The kid now started repeating and talking sentences, the first time to experience this, is very sweet.
* They are able to tell you to do something, in very short sentences, which they learned from you, and sometimes, even with some tweaks added by themselves.
* They ask you to sit nearby, read them a book, draw with them, and they want to have you near them all the time even if they decided to play a bit themselves.
* The one midday nap schedule remained unchanged and for high chance will remain this way for several years, good for those who like to have some routine.
* You may want to train them to play by themselves here and there, not an easy task :-)
